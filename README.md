# Movie-Recommendation-system
Recommender systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. The  recommender systems  help their users to identify the correct product or movies for them.Â 
Both the users and the services provided have benefited from these kinds of systems. The quality and decision-making process has also improved through these kinds of systems.
